# Quest Workflow Reference

## Workflow Routing

The canonical recursive runner resolves runnable work from the active workflow
definition. Machine states declare `run.profile`, and the selected profile supplies
the harness, prompt, runtime-context toggles, task template, modify rules, and thread
templates. The packaged default workflow lives under `default_workflow/`.

The runner reuses one thread per profile scope:

- quest-scoped profiles: `{repo}_quest_{quest_number:04d}_{profile}`
- child-scoped profiles: `{repo}_quest_{quest_number:04d}_slice_{child_number:04d}_{profile}`

## Prompt Contract

Every profile message should make the following explicit:

- current quest
- current profile
- active child path when the profile exposes one
- path to this quest reference directory when the profile exposes one
- current experiment id when running in an experiment worktree

The first message in a profile thread includes:

1. the profile prompt from the workflow profile
2. workflow-rendered runtime context
3. the current task instruction

Later messages reuse the same thread and include:

1. workflow-rendered runtime context
2. the current task instruction

## Ownership Rules

- `physical_planner` writes slice plans, not code.
- `physical_planner` must fully plan all work explicitly required by the quest spec.
- `physical_planner` must not leave stubs or placeholder planning for
  spec-defined work.
- `physical_planner` must escalate to a human if further research is required to
  complete the plan.
- On the initial `PhysicalPlanning` pass, `physical_planner` decides the full ordered
  slice list, initializes slice scaffolding with `scripts/quest-runner slices init`,
  then writes the slice plans from the quest specs.
- `physical_planner` appends to quest-root `physicalplan_issue_responses.md` when
  addressing open physical plan issues; only `physical_planner` may write that file.
- When `ReviewPhysicalPlan` sends the quest back to `PhysicalPlanning`, the planner
  should address the open review issues, update the plans, and record per-issue
  responses in `physicalplan_issue_responses.md` rather than receiving the initial
  planning task again.
- `physical_plan_reviewer` writes only quest-level `physicalplan_issues.md` and must
  read `physicalplan_issue_responses.md` when verifying planner follow-up; reviewers
  must never write to `physicalplan_issue_responses.md`. When the issue list is clear
  and the review is accepted, it creates `physicalplan_accepted.md`.
- `implementer` writes code/tests for the current slice and creates
  `implementation_done.md` when complete.
- `polisher_reviewer` writes only slice-level `polishing_issues.md` and must read
  `slices/<slice>/polishing_issue_responses.md` when verifying polisher follow-up;
  reviewers must never write to `polishing_issue_responses.md`. When the issue list is
  clear and the review is accepted, it creates `implementation_accepted.md`.
- `polisher` fixes open polishing issues but does not close them; only `polisher` may
  append to `slices/<slice>/polishing_issue_responses.md` for that slice.
- `integration_tester` writes and runs quest-level integration tests after all slices
  are complete. It creates and closes issues in `integration_test_issues.md`, but does
  not fix the bugs it finds.
- `integration_test_polisher` fixes open integration test issues but does not close
  them; only `integration_test_polisher` may append to
  `integration_test_issue_responses.md`.
- `documenter` writes only the current project's `docs/` directory, normally
  `projects/<project>/docs/`.

Normative format for issue response files: `docs/quest/schemas/issue-responses.md`.

## Issue Lifecycle

- Reviewers create and close issues in reviewer-owned issue files; statuses remain only
  `open` or `completed`.
- Responders record how they addressed each open issue they touch by appending sections
  to the matching issue responses file (`physicalplan_issue_responses.md` or
  `polishing_issue_responses.md` or `integration_test_issue_responses.md`); they must
  not mark reviewer-owned issues `completed`.
- Reviewers read issue responses when re-checking open issues; they must not edit
  response files—if a response is inadequate, they update the issue and/or escalate.
- If an issue stays `open` across more than one cycle after the responder had a chance
  to reply, the reviewer enriches the issue with actionable detail (what was checked,
  what is still wrong, what would close it).
- If reviewer and responder positions remain in conflict after one more focused update
  cycle (including `Fixed` vs reviewer-disagrees or `NotFixed` due to scope/spec
  dispute), the reviewer escalates via quest-root `human_intervention_request.md`.
- Non-reviewer roles may add implementation notes or fixes, but must not mark
  reviewer-owned issues `completed`.
- If work cannot proceed without a major decision or clarification, write
  `human_intervention_request.md` and stop.

## Slice Execution Loop

1. Runner selects the current role from quest state and slice state.
2. Runner sends the role prompt and task.
3. Implementer always receives an additional follow-up asking it to create
   `implementation_done.md` if the slice is complete.
4. Reviewers receive an additional follow-up only when their issue list is clear,
   asking them to create `physicalplan_accepted.md` or `implementation_accepted.md`.
5. Runner evaluates file-based predicates and issue-file state.
6. Runner records each successful top-level step in git (one commit per step, with
   recursive metadata in the commit message). Legacy quests may still have
   `state_history.md` entries from older runners, and dashboard readers merge both
   history sources.

## Experiment workflow

Experiments replay a completed quest from an earlier step using a separate
worktree. Metadata and landed archives live under
`<quest_dir>/experiments/<number>/` on the source checkout.

### Agent CLI requirement

When runtime context includes an experiment id, every Quest Runner CLI call from
that agent must pass `--experiment-id <id>`. The original quest worktree may not
exist. Commands that omit the experiment id fail when only the experiment worktree
is available.

### Experiment completion

When the configured stop condition is reached, the quest filesystem state becomes
`ExperimentComplete` and source metadata status becomes `experiment_complete`.
This is not normal quest landing. Operators land experiments with
`scripts/quest-runner experiments land` or `POST /experiments/land` after review.

### Archived experiment artifacts

After landing, JSONL logs copy to `experiments/<number>/logs/`. Issues and issue
responses copy to `experiments/<number>/issues/` and
`experiments/<number>/issue_responses/` with quest-relative paths preserved.
