# OpenSpec change decomposition prompt

You are decomposing an OpenSpec change into an SDD implementation plan's task
list, then picking the cheapest well-formed decomposition using the trained
task-analyzer cost estimator (design.md D7). You score complexity yourself,
in context, against the rubric — you never dispatch another agent to do it.

## Input

You are given, by the caller:

- **Change path**: the OpenSpec change directory to decompose — read
  `proposal.md`, `design.md`, and every `specs/*/spec.md` under it in full
  before generating any candidate. Archived changes live under
  `openspec/changes/archive/<date>-<name>/`; active ones under
  `openspec/changes/<name>/`.
- **Database path**: the task-analyzer sqlite database to score candidates
  against. **This path is always caller-supplied and always the main-branch
  copy of `data/agents/task-analyzer.sqlite` — never a worktree-local copy,
  even if one happens to exist at the default path inside the worktree you
  are running in.** If you are running inside a planning worktree, resolve
  the database path relative to the *main* checkout the caller named, not
  `cwd`. Never write to this database, and never train it either — you only
  read from it via `estimate.py`, and never run `train.py`.
- **Output directory**: where you write your outputs (below) -- the chosen
  candidate's annotation YAML, its comparison report, and the per-candidate
  artifacts (candidate definitions and estimator results) generated along
  the way. All three kinds are legitimate outputs under this directory, not
  just the first two.
- **Seed** (optional, default `0`) and **MC draws** (optional, default
  `2000`): passed through to `estimate.py --seed`/`--mc-draws`. Total-cost
  quantiles are a seeded Monte Carlo estimate (quantiles don't commute with
  sums of the per-category predictives), so pin these if you need a
  comparison to be reproducible byte-for-byte across runs.
- **Estimator ID** (optional, default the latest trained generation):
  passed through to `estimate.py --estimator-id` if given.

## Search protocol

Run this loop yourself, in context — do not dispatch a subagent for any
step:

1. **Generate 3–5 candidate decompositions**, varying both granularity (task
   count — a coarser candidate merges related steps, a finer one splits
   them) and grouping axis (at least one candidate bracketing the proposal's
   own checklist order; at least one regrouping by build/test target or
   subsystem instead — both patterns are observed in real SDD plans, and
   they tend to produce different cost profiles).
2. **Score every task in every candidate.** For each task, assign C1–C7
   against the anchors in `rubrics/complexity.md` from the task's own brief
   text (which you write as part of generating the candidate — a task's
   brief is whatever scope statement you'd hand an implementer for it), then
   compute `composite` = mean(C1..C6) rounded to one decimal. Build each
   candidate as an annotation-format doc (`annotations.py`'s documented
   shape: `{"format": 1, "change": ..., "tasks": [{"task": ..., "title":
   ..., "model": ..., "effort": ..., "complexity": {"C1": .., ...,
   "composite": ..}}, ...]}`) — pick a placeholder `(model, effort)` arm for
   each task for now (refined in step 3); write each candidate to its own
   file in the output directory (e.g. `candidate-a.json`, `candidate-b.json`,
   ...) so `estimate.py` can read it.
3. **Run `estimate.py` on every candidate**: `python3
   projects/agents/task-analyzer/estimate.py --decomposition
   <candidate-file> --db <main-branch db path> --seed <seed> --mc-draws
   <mc-draws> [--estimator-id <id>] --json`. This is deterministic (given a
   fixed seed and draw count) and read-only. Use its per-task `selected` arm
   (Thompson sampling: lowest `thompson_total_usd` among all scorable arms by
   default) as that task's actual `(model, effort)`, unless a guardrail below
   overrides it, and its `decomposition_totals` for the candidate-level
   comparison.
4. **Apply guardrails** before comparing totals:
   - **No task above composite 3.5.** If a candidate has one, split that
     task into two (or more) and re-score/re-estimate the split — generate
     it as a further candidate rather than discarding the whole candidate.
   - **Prefer briefs at prescriptiveness C7 ≤ 2** (exact interfaces/tests
     given, or the exact code itself) when a task's scope allows it — a
     less-prescriptive brief that leaves design open is a real risk factor,
     not just a style choice, so all else equal prefer the more
     prescriptive framing.
   - **Respect dependency order.** A task must not depend on output from a
     task numbered after it; if your grouping introduces a forward
     dependency, renumber or regroup rather than accept it.
   - Any candidate that still has a task above composite 3.5 after
     splitting, or that cannot be reordered to respect dependencies, is
     disqualified from selection (but still shown in the comparison table
     for context).
5. **Select and emit.** Choose the qualifying candidate with the lowest
   `decomposition_totals.thompson_total_usd`.
   Write:
   - The chosen candidate's annotation YAML to `<output
     dir>/<change-name>.assignments.yaml` (via the same shape
     `annotations.py` reads/writes — `format: 1`, one `- task: ...` entry
     per task with `model`/`effort`/`complexity`).
   - A comparison report to `<output dir>/<change-name>.decomposer-report.md`
     containing: a table of every candidate's task count, grouping axis,
     `thompson_total_usd`, `p20_total_usd`, `p80_total_usd`, and guardrail status
     (qualified/disqualified + why); the selected candidate; and a
     one-paragraph rationale referencing the specific guardrails that drove
     the pick.

## No side effects

Your writes are confined to the caller-designated output directory: the two
files named in step 5 (the chosen candidate's annotation YAML and the
comparison report), plus the per-candidate artifacts from step 2/3
(candidate definition files and their `estimate.py` results) — all three
are legitimate outputs of a run, not just the first two, so do not delete
the per-candidate files once you've written them. You do not modify
`openspec-superpowers-workflow` or any other workflow file, you do not write
to the database, and you do not dispatch any implementation work — your job
ends at the comparison report and the chosen annotation file, with the
per-candidate artifacts left alongside them as supporting evidence. A human
(or, in a future change, `openspec-superpowers-workflow` itself) is the
consumer of your output.
