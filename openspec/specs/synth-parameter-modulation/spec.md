## Purpose

Define the C++ synth parameter and modulation library, including ownership,
scene and gesture computation, audio-rate modulation reads, physical-control
routing, and randomized simulation coverage.
## Requirements
### Requirement: spm-1 — Project: C++ synth library
WHEN the synth parameter modulation capability is implemented, THE repository SHALL contain a `projects/synth` C++20 project with library sources, public headers, a project Makefile exposing `all`, `build`, `test`, and `clean`, and root Makefile targets that include `synth` in normal project build and test flows.

#### Scenario: Project builds through root Makefile
- **WHEN** a developer runs the root `make synth-build`
- **THEN** the synth library builds from `projects/synth`

#### Scenario: Project tests through root Makefile
- **WHEN** a developer runs the root `make synth-test`
- **THEN** the synth parameter modulation test suite runs from `projects/synth`

### Requirement: spm-2 — Ownership: manager, groups, parameters, banks, and slots
WHEN constructing the synth parameter system, THE system SHALL use a single `ParameterManager` to own global scene state, global gesture state, page state, parameter groups, banks, slots, and the global parameter ID space; the manager's gesture count SHALL default to zero and MAY be changed only before any group is created; `ParameterManager::CreateGroup` SHALL inject the manager's fixed gesture count and a non-owning manager pointer into each `ParameterGroup`; each `ParameterGroup` SHALL own its processing/storage config, `Modulators`, injected gesture count for arena sizing, non-owning manager pointer, and allocator, but SHALL NOT own gesture values, gesture selection, gesture metadata, parameter base colors, or parameter indicator palettes; each `Parameter` SHALL be allocated by exactly one group, own its resolved base/indicator appearance, and read runtime gesture values, selection, and metadata through the owning manager context rather than through group-local gesture state; banks and slots SHALL hold non-owning parameter pointers only.

#### Scenario: Parameter receives globally unique ID
- **WHEN** parameters are created across multiple groups
- **THEN** the manager assigns each parameter a unique global ID

#### Scenario: Bank does not own parameter lifetime
- **WHEN** a bank is populated with parameters from one or more groups
- **THEN** destroying or deselecting the bank does not destroy those parameters

#### Scenario: Gestures are manager-owned across groups
- **WHEN** parameters from two groups are edited while gesture 1 is selected
- **THEN** both parameters observe the same manager-owned gesture 1 selected state and gesture value

#### Scenario: Gesture count is fixed before groups
- **WHEN** a manager is configured with two gestures before any group is created
- **THEN** every subsequently created group sizes parameter gesture arrays from that count
- **AND** changing gesture count after group creation is not supported

#### Scenario: Default manager gesture count is zero
- **WHEN** a manager is default constructed and no gesture count is configured before group creation
- **THEN** subsequently created groups size parameter gesture arrays for zero gestures

#### Scenario: Group cannot carry independent gesture count
- **WHEN** a group is created through a manager configured with two gestures
- **THEN** the group receives gesture count `2` from the manager
- **AND** no `ParameterGroupConfig` field can override that count

#### Scenario: Group cannot carry parameter appearance
- **WHEN** two parameters share one group
- **THEN** each parameter can own a different base color and per-voice indicator palette
- **AND** no group field can override either appearance

### Requirement: spm-3 — Pages: assignment and active UI page
WHEN parameters are assigned to pages, THE manager SHALL maintain page ordinals within the manager, allow each parameter to be assigned to zero or more pages, and expose exactly one active page for UI routing without changing parameter audio values, scene values, gesture values, or modulation routes.

#### Scenario: Active page changes routing only
- **WHEN** the active page changes
- **THEN** subsequent routed UI actions target the new page mapping
- **AND** existing parameter center, depth, scene, gesture, and modulator values remain unchanged

### Requirement: spm-4 — Group config: dynamic shape and upfront allocation
WHEN a `ParameterGroup` is configured, THE group SHALL use runtime configuration for voice count, modulator count, scene count, maximum parameter count, process-lite alpha, target-center alpha, target compute interval in samples, UI display-center alpha, and UI display-spread alpha; SHALL NOT accept parameter base colors, voice indicator colors, a voice color palette, or an independent gesture count in group configuration; the target-center alpha SHALL default to a 50 Hz-style one-pole alpha at the default target-compute cadence; the target compute interval SHALL default to 16 samples and SHALL be positive; process-lite alpha, target-center alpha, UI display-center alpha, and UI display-spread alpha SHALL be in `[0, 1]`; SHALL size parameter per-scene/per-gesture arrays from the owning manager's gesture count injected by `ParameterManager::CreateGroup`; SHALL allocate per-parameter subarrays upfront through a group-owned allocator; and SHALL perform no heap allocation during `Compute`, per-sample parameter processing, `ProcessLite`, `GetRaw`, cached knob reads, routed reset-modifier press, routed random-modifier press, routed tick handling, or routed unmodified press handling after any needed modulation-depth parameters for that view have already been materialized. Routed unmodified press and random-mod modifier operations MAY lazily materialize missing modulation-depth parameter objects from preconfigured group capacity.

#### Scenario: Same-shaped group parameters
- **WHEN** two parameters are created in the same group
- **THEN** both parameters have subarrays sized from the same group shape and the owning manager's gesture count

#### Scenario: Allocation exhaustion
- **WHEN** creating a parameter would exceed the group allocator capacity
- **THEN** creation fails without registering a partial parameter in the manager or any bank

#### Scenario: Gesture count is not group-owned
- **WHEN** group configuration is inspected
- **THEN** it contains no independent gesture count field
- **AND** every parameter in the group uses the gesture count supplied by the manager

#### Scenario: Voice indicator colors are not group-owned
- **WHEN** group configuration is inspected
- **THEN** it contains no voice indicator palette
- **AND** parameter UI state obtains indicator colors from each parameter's resolved configuration

#### Scenario: Default target center alpha is configured
- **WHEN** a group is created without overriding its target-center alpha
- **THEN** the group configuration reports the default target-center alpha

#### Scenario: Target center alpha must be normalized
- **WHEN** a group is configured with target-center alpha less than `0` or greater than `1`
- **THEN** group creation rejects the configuration

#### Scenario: Default target compute interval is 16 samples
- **WHEN** a group is created without overriding its target compute interval
- **THEN** the group configuration reports a target compute interval of 16 samples

#### Scenario: Target compute interval must be positive
- **WHEN** a group is configured with target compute interval `0`
- **THEN** group creation rejects the configuration

### Requirement: spm-5 — Modulators: flat per-voice values and metadata
WHEN a group owns modulators, THE `Modulators` struct SHALL store current modulator values in one flat row-major array indexed as `voiceIx * numModulators + modulatorIx`, store per-modulator metadata including name, short name, color, and connected flag, and provide an `Apply(voiceIx, depths)` function that returns only the dot product of that voice's modulator row and the supplied depth row.

#### Scenario: Apply computes a voice-local dot product
- **WHEN** a group has `numModulators = 3`, voice 2 values `[0.25, -0.5, 1.0]`, and supplied depths `[0.4, 0.2, -0.1]`
- **THEN** `Apply(2, depths)` returns `(0.25 * 0.4) + (-0.5 * 0.2) + (1.0 * -0.1)`

#### Scenario: Metadata is not per voice
- **WHEN** a modulator name, short name, or color is changed
- **THEN** the changed metadata applies to that modulator for every voice

### Requirement: spm-6 — Gestures: values, selection, metadata, and active flags
WHEN the synth parameter system owns gestures, THE `ParameterManager` SHALL own one `Gestures` state containing global gesture values, selected flags, and per-gesture metadata, while each parameter SHALL store per-scene/per-gesture gesture values and active flags; gesture values and active flags SHALL NOT be stored per voice, and gesture selection SHALL NOT be stored per group.

#### Scenario: Gesture selection is global to manager
- **WHEN** gesture 1 is selected on the manager
- **THEN** all parameters in every group observe gesture 1 as selected for edit routing

#### Scenario: Parameter gesture state is per scene
- **WHEN** a gesture is active for scene 0 on one parameter
- **THEN** the same gesture can remain inactive for scene 1 and for other parameters

#### Scenario: Gesture metadata is shared
- **WHEN** gesture 1 metadata is changed on the manager
- **THEN** every group and UI snapshot reads the same gesture 1 metadata

### Requirement: spm-7 — Parameter data: metadata, scene state, modulation routes, and runtime state
WHEN a `Parameter` is created, THE parameter SHALL store name, short name, global ID, recursion depth, default normalized value, bipolar flag, group pointer, current center value, target center value, current center scale for each voice, target center scale for each voice, current modulation depths for each voice/modulator pair, target modulation depths for each voice/modulator pair, nullable modulation-depth parameter pointers for each modulator, scene center values, and per-scene/per-gesture gesture values and active flags.

#### Scenario: Default parameter state
- **WHEN** a parameter is created with default value `0.3`
- **THEN** its scene center values, current center, and target center are initialized to `0.3`
- **AND** its current and target center scales are initialized to `1.0`
- **AND** its modulation-depth pointers are null
- **AND** its current and target modulation depths are zero

### Requirement: spm-8 — Compute: scene, gesture interpolation, and target-center smoothing
WHEN `Parameter::Compute()` calculates target state, THE parameter SHALL first compute the raw center as `sceneCenter[leftScene] * (1 - blend) + sceneCenter[rightScene] * blend`; SHALL compute each gesture's blended gesture value from the parameter's scene gesture values; SHALL compute each gesture's effective weight from the manager-owned gesture value where that gesture is active in the blended scenes; SHALL use the base scene value as the raw center when no effective gesture weight is active; SHALL otherwise use the weighted average of `base * (1 - weight) + gestureValue * weight` across active gestures as the raw center; SHALL slew a top-level parameter's `targetCenter` toward the raw center using the owning group's target-center alpha and the one-pole formula `targetCenter += alpha * (rawCenter - targetCenter)`; and SHALL keep recursive modulation-depth computations assigning `targetCenter` from the raw center before snapping current state to target for parent consumption.

#### Scenario: Scene blend without active gestures
- **WHEN** left scene center is `0.2`, right scene center is `0.8`, blend is `0.25`, and no gesture has effective weight
- **THEN** the raw computed center is `0.35`

#### Scenario: Active gesture blends from base to gesture value
- **WHEN** base is `0.4`, one gesture has blended gesture value `0.9`, and its manager-owned effective weight is `0.5`
- **THEN** the raw computed center is `0.65`

#### Scenario: Cross-group parameters use the same gesture weight
- **WHEN** two parameters in different groups have gesture 1 active
- **AND** the manager-owned gesture 1 value is `0.5`

#### Scenario: Top-level compute slews target center
- **WHEN** a top-level parameter has target center `0.0`, raw computed center `1.0`, and group target-center alpha `0.25`
- **THEN** one `Compute()` call sets target center to `0.25`

#### Scenario: Target center alpha one snaps top-level target center
- **WHEN** a top-level parameter has target center `0.0`, raw computed center `1.0`, and group target-center alpha `1.0`
- **THEN** one `Compute()` call sets target center to `1.0`

#### Scenario: Recursive modulation-depth compute remains immediate
- **WHEN** a modulation-depth parameter is computed recursively for a parent parameter
- **THEN** the modulation-depth parameter assigns its target center from the raw computed center for that recursive compute
- **AND** the modulation-depth parameter snaps current center, center scales, normalization offsets, min/max values, and modulation depths to target before the parent reads the depth value

### Requirement: spm-9 — Compute: signed modulation normalization
WHEN `Parameter::Compute()` calculates per-voice modulation depths, THE parameter SHALL derive the normalization factor from `sum(abs(rawDepth[voice][modIx]))`; SHALL use each raw depth unchanged when the factor is less than or equal to `1`; SHALL divide every raw depth by the factor when the factor is greater than `1`; SHALL set the per-voice center scale to `max(0, 1 - normalizationFactor)`; SHALL derive a per-voice normalization offset from the effective normalized depths as `-sum(min(0, effectiveDepth[voice][modIx]))`; and SHALL include that offset in both target and current audio-rate reads before adding the modulator dot product. `ProcessLite` SHALL slew the normalization offset with the same control-rate smoothing model as center scale and modulation depths.

#### Scenario: Mixed positive and negative depths offset the unipolar modulator range
- **WHEN** a unipolar parameter has raw depths `+0.25` and `-0.5`
- **THEN** its center scale is `0.25`
- **AND** its normalization offset is `0.5`
- **AND** audio-rate reads use `center * 0.25 + 0.5 + mod0 * 0.25 + mod1 * -0.5`

#### Scenario: Overfull mixed depths derive offset after normalization
- **WHEN** a unipolar parameter has raw depths `+1.0` and `-1.0`
- **THEN** its effective depths are `+0.5` and `-0.5`
- **AND** its normalization offset is `0.5`
- **AND** the offset is not derived from the unnormalized negative raw depth

### Requirement: spm-70 — Parameters: unipolar core value domain
WHEN parameter state is configured, edited, computed, smoothed, cached, or serialized, THE synth parameter modulation system SHALL represent defaults, scene centers, gesture values, current and target centers, cached knob values, dynamic min/max values, and modulation-depth control values in normalized `[0, 1]` space regardless of bipolar presentation metadata; SHALL use bipolar metadata only when validating bipolar mapping helpers or converting normalized values for signed consumption and UI publication; and SHALL preserve the existing bounded crossfade modulation law and signed overfull-depth normalization in normalized space.

#### Scenario: Bipolar neutral is stored at normalized center
- **WHEN** a bipolar parameter represents signed neutral `0`
- **THEN** its internal default, scene, current, target, and cached knob values are `0.5`

#### Scenario: Positive full-depth crossfade reaches the source
- **WHEN** a parameter has effective depth `1` from one modulation route
- **THEN** its center scale is `0`
- **AND** its normalized result equals that route's unipolar modulation source
- **AND** a bipolar read maps the resulting source range `0..1` to `-1..1`

#### Scenario: Negative full-depth crossfade reaches the inverted source
- **WHEN** a parameter has effective depth `-1` from one modulation route
- **THEN** its center scale is `0`
- **AND** its normalization offset is `1`
- **AND** its normalized result equals `1 - source`
- **AND** a bipolar read maps that result to the negated signed source

#### Scenario: Bipolar UI conversion occurs at publication
- **WHEN** a bipolar parameter has normalized display center `0.25` and normalized min/max values `0` and `1`
- **AND** `Parameter::PopulateUIState` publishes its snapshot
- **THEN** the snapshot reports signed display center `-0.5` and signed min/max values `-1` and `1`

#### Scenario: Serialized parameter values use the core domain
- **WHEN** parameter value JSON is saved after this change
- **THEN** bipolar parameter values and modulation-depth control values are serialized in normalized `[0, 1]` space

### Requirement: spm-10 — Compute: dynamic modulation min/max
WHEN `Parameter::Compute()` calculates per-voice modulation state, THE parameter SHALL also compute per-voice target minimum and maximum values in normalized `[0, 1]` space representing the audio-rate range reachable from unipolar `[0, 1]` modulation sources; SHALL slew current minimum and maximum values in normalized space in `ProcessLite`; and SHALL publish those values through `Parameter::UIState::minValues` and `Parameter::UIState::maxValues`, converting them to `[-1, 1]` only when the parameter has bipolar presentation metadata. If `sum(abs(rawDepth[voice][modIx])) > 1`, the normalized target min/max SHALL be the full `0..1` range. Otherwise, min/max SHALL be computed from the current effective formula as `base + sum(min(0, effectiveDepth))` and `base + sum(max(0, effectiveDepth))`, clamped to `[0, 1]`, where `base = center * centerScale + normalizationOffset`.

#### Scenario: UI state publishes dynamic underfull min/max

### Requirement: spm-11 — Audio path: Get and ProcessLite
WHEN the audio engine samples a parameter, THE synth parameter modulation system SHALL provide `Parameter::GetRaw(voiceIx)` as the explicit normalized `[0, 1]` read path for every parameter polarity, returning the `[0, 1]`-clamped value `currentCenter * currentCenterScale[voiceIx] + currentNormalizationOffset[voiceIx] + group.modulators.Apply(voiceIx, currentDepthsForVoice)` without traversing manager, page, bank, slot, scene, gesture, or modulation route state; `ProcessLite()` SHALL advance current center, current center scales, current normalization offsets, current min/max values, and current modulation depths toward targets using the one-pole formula `current += alpha * (target - current)` with the owning group's configured process-lite alpha, then SHALL sample and store each voice's normalized cached knob value from `GetRaw(voiceIx)`; and per-sample parameter processing SHALL recompute target state from the owning manager's current scene when `sampleIndex % group.Config().targetComputeIntervalSamples == 0` before running `ProcessLite()`, including target-center smoothing for top-level parameters.

#### Scenario: GetRaw uses current state only
- **WHEN** `GetRaw(0)` is called after `Compute()` and `ProcessLite()`
- **THEN** it uses only the parameter's current center, current center scale for voice 0, current normalization offset for voice 0, the current depth row for voice 0, and the group's current modulator row for voice 0
- **AND** it returns a normalized value in `[0, 1]` regardless of bipolar presentation metadata

#### Scenario: ProcessLite slews center
- **WHEN** current center is `0.0`, target center is `1.0`, and alpha is `0.25`

- **THEN** one `ProcessLite()` call sets current center scale for voice 0 to `0.875`

#### Scenario: ProcessLite samples cached knob value
- **WHEN** `ProcessLite()` has advanced the current center, center scale, normalization offset, and depth state for a voice
- **THEN** it stores that voice's normalized cached knob value from `GetRaw(voiceIx)` using the group's current modulator row

#### Scenario: Per-sample processing recomputes on configured interval
- **WHEN** a parameter's group target compute interval is 16 samples
- **AND** per-sample parameter processing is called with sample indexes 15 and 16
- **THEN** the sample 15 call runs `ProcessLite()` without recomputing targets
- **AND** the sample 16 call recomputes targets from the owning manager's current scene before running `ProcessLite()`

#### Scenario: Per-sample processing recomputes on first sample
- **WHEN** a parameter's group target compute interval is 16 samples
- **AND** per-sample parameter processing is called with sample index 0
- **THEN** the call recomputes targets from the owning manager's current scene before running `ProcessLite()`

#### Scenario: Per-sample recompute slews top-level target center
- **WHEN** a top-level parameter's group target compute interval is 16 samples
- **AND** the parameter has target center `0.0`, raw computed center `1.0`, and group target-center alpha `0.25`
- **AND** per-sample parameter processing is called with sample index `16`
- **THEN** the target recompute sets target center to `0.25` before `ProcessLite()` slews current center toward that target

#### Scenario: Per-sample group processing covers group parameters
- **WHEN** per-sample processing is invoked for a parameter group at an absolute sample index
- **THEN** every top-level parameter owned by that group runs the same per-sample parameter processing step for that sample index

#### Scenario: Per-sample group processing refreshes modulation-depth targets
- **WHEN** a top-level group parameter has a materialized modulation-depth parameter
- **AND** per-sample group processing recomputes targets for that group
- **THEN** the top-level parameter's modulation-depth target state reflects the owning manager's current scene through the same recursive compute path used by top-level `Compute()`

#### Scenario: Cached knob formalizes one-sample modulation delay
- **WHEN** mapped DSP reads consume a parameter after `ProcessLite()`
- **AND** a modulation source updates the group's modulator row later in the same sample frame
- **THEN** mapped DSP reads continue to use the cached knob value sampled by the earlier `ProcessLite()` call
- **AND** the later modulator update is visible to the next sample frame's `ProcessLite()` cache refresh

#### Scenario: Cached knob is seeded before steady-state ProcessLite

- **THEN** each voice's cached normalized knob value is seeded from `GetRaw(voiceIx)`
- **AND** each voice's normalized UI display center is seeded to that cached knob value
- **AND** each voice's UI display spread energy is seeded to `0`

### Requirement: spm-12 — Edits: HandleIncDec scene and gesture distribution
WHEN `Parameter::HandleIncDec(delta)` is called, THE parameter SHALL apply the delta to the active scene center value when blend is at one scene endpoint and no gesture distribution is active, SHALL distribute the delta across the two active scene center values when blend is between scenes using the Smart Grid scene distribution formula, SHALL treat the first turn for any selected inactive gesture as an arming turn that activates the gesture for the touched scene endpoints and snapshots each touched parent scene value into the matching gesture value without applying the delta, and SHALL distribute non-arming turns between active gesture values and base scene values according to Smart Grid-style effective gesture weights regardless of current gesture selection.

#### Scenario: Endpoint scene edit
- **WHEN** blend is `0`, left scene is active, and `HandleIncDec(0.1)` is called
- **THEN** only the left scene center value is incremented and clamped to the parameter range

#### Scenario: Selected inactive gesture arming
- **WHEN** a selected gesture is inactive for the current scene and `HandleIncDec(delta)` is called
- **THEN** the gesture becomes active for that scene
- **AND** its gesture value is copied from the current parent scene value
- **AND** the delta is not applied to the parent scene value or to the newly activated gesture value on that call

#### Scenario: Active high gesture edit after deselection
- **WHEN** a gesture is already active for the current scene
- **AND** the gesture is not currently selected
- **AND** the manager-owned gesture weight is `1.0`
- **AND** the gesture value is above the parent scene value
- **THEN** `HandleIncDec(delta)` applies the full clamped delta to the gesture value
- **AND** leaves the parent scene value unchanged

#### Scenario: Active gesture distribution
- **WHEN** one or more gestures are already active for the current scene selection
- **AND** their active effective weight sum is greater than zero
- **THEN** `HandleIncDec(delta)` distributes the gesture portion as `delta * weight * weight / activeEffectiveWeightSum` for each active gesture
- **AND** distributes the base portion as `delta * sum(weight * (1 - weight)) / activeEffectiveWeightSum`
- **AND** applies each portion through the scene distribution formula for the active scene blend

### Requirement: spm-13 — Revert: defaults and modulation clearing
WHEN a parameter is reverted to default for the current scene selection, THE parameter SHALL clear all modulation-depth parameter assignments, zero current and target modulation depth arrays, set applicable scene center values to the default normalized value, set applicable scene gesture active flags to false, and update current/target center consistently with the owning group's slew and recursion-depth rules.

#### Scenario: Reset modifier clears modulation
- **WHEN** a routed reset-modifier press resets a parameter
- **THEN** the parameter has no non-null modulation-depth parameter pointers
- **AND** `GetRaw(voiceIx)` returns the default-centered value after compute/process settling with zero modulators
- **AND** the cached knob value is seeded or slewed consistently with the current raw value through the applicable snap or `ProcessLite` path

### Requirement: spm-14 — Banks and slots: physical control mapping
WHEN banks and bank slots are configured, THE system SHALL allow each bank to list parameter pointers and physical encoder IDs, allow banks to include parameters from different groups, allow each slot to select one bank at a time, and require slot bank selection to deselect any modulation view open on the previously selected bank before showing the newly selected bank.

#### Scenario: Mixed-group bank
- **WHEN** a bank contains parameters from two groups
- **THEN** routed encoder actions dispatch to each parameter through its own owning group

#### Scenario: Slot bank switch deselects prior view
- **WHEN** a slot selects a new bank while the previous bank is showing a modulation-depth view
- **THEN** the previous bank returns to its top-level parameter view before the new bank is selected

### Requirement: spm-15 — Banks and slots: press, shift-press, and tick routing
WHEN a bank handles a press on a mapped physical encoder, THE bank SHALL populate the pressed parameter's visible modulation-depth cells from parent-owned modulation-depth controls, SHALL materialize missing modulation-depth controls as local bipolar default-zero controls when group capacity allows, SHALL NOT append those modulation-depth controls to the manager global parameter list, SHALL initialize lazily materialized modulation-depth control short name and color from the corresponding modulator metadata, SHALL derive an effective depth control name from the target parameter name plus the modulator metadata name when the metadata name is non-empty, SHALL derive an effective fallback name from the target parameter name plus the one-based modulation index when the metadata name is empty, and SHALL place the selected top-level parameter in the final physical slot position as the return cell when the press is routed through a `BankSlot`; direct bank presses without a slot layout SHALL use the bank's compact top-level mapping order as the physical layout fallback. If a routed slot has `N` physical positions, THE system SHALL reserve position `N - 1` for the return cell, SHALL use positions `0..N-2` for modulation-depth cells, SHALL leave unused positions before the return cell disconnected, and SHALL treat `numModulators > N - 1` as a configuration error. Pressing a modulation cell with no effective modifier SHALL open that modulation control's modulation view; pressing the return cell with no effective modifier SHALL restore the top-level bank; tick SHALL route to the parameter or modulation-depth control visible in the cell; reset-modifier press SHALL revert the visible top-level parameter to default and neutralize its modulation-depth subtree without deleting those controls; random-modifier press SHALL randomize the visible knob value while leaving that target's modulation routes intact; random-mod modifier press SHALL apply geometric modulation randomization to the visible target; and routed manager/slot APIs SHALL dispatch press and tick/inc-dec events by physical encoder ID to the selected bank.

#### Scenario: Press opens modulation view
- **WHEN** a bank is showing top-level parameters and the user presses a parameter encoder through a slot with no effective modifier
- **THEN** the bank shows that parameter's modulation-depth cells in the first slot positions
- **AND** shows the selected parameter as the return cell in the final slot position

#### Scenario: Slot gap remains disconnected

- **AND** the pressed parameter's group has one modulator
- **THEN** the modulation-depth cell occupies the first slot position
- **AND** the middle slot position is disconnected
- **AND** the return cell occupies the third slot position

#### Scenario: Too many modulators for slot layout is an error
- **WHEN** a slot has three physical positions
- **AND** the pressed parameter's group has three modulators
- **THEN** opening that parameter's modulation view fails as a configuration error because no final slot position remains reserved for return

#### Scenario: Lazy depth metadata follows modulator

- **AND** modulator `0` has name `Filter Env`, short name `Env`, and color `Cyan`
- **THEN** the created depth control has name `Carrier Filter Env`
- **AND** has short name `Env`
- **AND** has color `Cyan`

#### Scenario: Duplicate modulator names remain unique per parent
- **WHEN** two target parameters both materialize local depth controls for a modulator named `Filter Env`
- **THEN** each created depth control name includes its target parameter name
- **AND** manager global parameter registration is not involved

#### Scenario: Empty modulator name uses indexed fallback
- **WHEN** opening a modulation view materializes a missing depth control for target parameter `Carrier` and modulator `1`
- **AND** modulator `1` has no name
- **THEN** the created depth control has name `Carrier Mod Depth 2`

#### Scenario: Reset keeps depth controls attached
- **WHEN** a reset-modifier press resets a parameter that owns modulation-depth controls
- **THEN** the parameter returns to its default value
- **AND** its modulation-depth controls are reset to neutral zero values
- **AND** those controls remain attached to the parent parameter for future modulation-view routing

#### Scenario: Random leaves depth controls attached
- **WHEN** a random-modifier press targets a parameter that owns modulation-depth controls
- **THEN** the parameter's active knob value changes to a generated normalized value
- **AND** its modulation-depth controls remain attached
- **AND** its modulation-depth control values remain unchanged

#### Scenario: Random-mod materializes depth controls
- **WHEN** a random-mod modifier press targets a top-level parameter with at least one empty modulator slot
- **AND** the random-mod loop chooses that empty slot
- **THEN** the system materializes that slot's modulation-depth control through the normal modulation-view capacity path
- **AND** randomizes the created depth control value

#### Scenario: Return cell closes modulation view
- **WHEN** a modulation-depth view is open
- **AND** the return cell in the final slot position is pressed with no effective modifier
- **THEN** the bank restores the top-level parameter view

#### Scenario: Tick routes to selected bank
- **WHEN** the manager receives a tick for a physical encoder ID owned by a slot's selected bank
- **THEN** the manager routes the delta through the slot and bank to the mapped parameter's `HandleIncDec`

### Requirement: spm-16 — Gesture API: external selection and values
WHEN external code controls gestures, THE parameter manager SHALL default to zero gestures, expose a non-replacing pre-group setup API to set gesture count before any group is created, reject or report failure for gesture-count changes after group creation, and expose runtime functions to select and deselect gestures, set gesture values, read gesture selected state, read gesture values, read and write gesture metadata, and clear a gesture's active flags across parameters for the active scene selection.

#### Scenario: External select gesture
- **WHEN** external code selects gesture 3 on the manager
- **THEN** subsequent parameter edits in every group treat gesture 3 as selected

#### Scenario: External change gesture value
- **WHEN** external code sets gesture 3 value to `0.75` on the manager
- **THEN** the next control-rate `Compute()` uses `0.75` as gesture 3's weight where that gesture is active

#### Scenario: External clear gesture active flags
- **WHEN** external code clears gesture 3 active flags for the active scene selection
- **THEN** matching gesture 3 active flags are cleared across parameters in every group owned by the manager

#### Scenario: Gesture count configuration precedes group creation
- **WHEN** a manager is constructed or configured with four gestures before groups are created
- **THEN** gesture APIs accept indices 0 through 3
- **AND** parameters created later allocate four per-scene gesture slots

#### Scenario: Gesture count cannot change after group creation

### Requirement: spm-46 — Parameters: registration IDs and lookup
WHEN modules or application code register top-level parameters, THE synth parameter modulation system SHALL provide a `ParameterManager::RegisterParameter` API, or equivalent manager-level API, that accepts a parameter group and `ParameterConfig`, validates the group and effective parameter name, creates the parameter in the supplied group, appends it to the manager's global parameter list, and returns a `ParameterId` equal to that parameter's index in the global parameter list for future module lookup; `CreateParameter` SHALL use the same global-list path, while modulation-depth controls SHALL remain parent-owned local controls without `ParameterId` values in the manager global list.

#### Scenario: First registered parameter is list index zero
- **WHEN** a fresh manager registers its first parameter

#### Scenario: Mapping helper uses cached ProcessLite value
- **WHEN** a mapped parameter has current modulation applied for a voice

### Requirement: spm-49 — Modulators: pointer-backed source registration and update
WHEN runtime modulation sources are produced by modules or application code, THE synth parameter modulation system SHALL provide a group-owned modulation-source manager, or equivalent `ParameterGroup`/`Modulators` API, where `SetModulationSource` is the source of truth for a modulator's metadata and per-voice source pointers, registers a modulation source by modulation index, per-voice array of `float` pointers, source name, short name, color, connected state, and related metadata, then updates current modulator values by dereferencing those pointers through `UpdateModValues` without applying scaling, normalization, or voice swapping.

#### Scenario: Source registration stores metadata
- **WHEN** code registers modulation source `0` with name `VCO`, short name `VCO`, color `Cyan`, and two voice pointers

#### Scenario: Update is sample-rate safe
- **WHEN** `UpdateModValues` is called every sample after initialization
- **THEN** it performs no heap allocation
- **AND** does not mutate source metadata

#### Scenario: Invalid source pointers fail
- **WHEN** source registration supplies the wrong number of voice pointers or a null pointer for a connected source

- **AND** load does not read parameter definitions, names, colors, ranges, polarity, or modulation assignments from the JSON child

#### Scenario: Missing modulation-depth storage skips without partial topology
- **WHEN** JSON contains a modulation-depth child for a live parent parameter but no storage is available for the corresponding local depth parameter
- **THEN** load leaves that child branch unapplied
- **AND** load continues applying other matching parameter values

#### Scenario: Saved value array shape mismatch keeps initialized values
- **WHEN** JSON contains a matching parameter name but its saved scene-center, gesture-value, or gesture-active array length differs from the live initialized parameter shape
- **THEN** load skips the mismatched array
- **AND** leaves the corresponding live values at their code-defined defaults from the load reset
- **AND** continues applying other matching arrays, recursive depth values, and other matching parameters

### Requirement: spm-54 — Persistence: manager-wide value reset
WHEN patch lifecycle code requests a full value reset, THE synth parameter modulation system SHALL reset every initialized top-level parameter and every existing modulation-depth parameter to its code-defined default value state without creating, deleting, renaming, recoloring, rerouting, or reconfiguring any parameter topology.

- **AND** gesture 63 renders as `64` rather than collapsing to another gesture's label

#### Scenario: More than 64 gestures is rejected
- **WHEN** code attempts to configure a manager with 65 gestures before group creation
- **THEN** configuration fails without changing the previous gesture topology

#### Scenario: Inactive gesture capacity does not add gesture evaluation
- **WHEN** a parameter belongs to a manager configured with 64 gestures
- **AND** none are active for either scene endpoint
- **THEN** parameter compute evaluates zero gesture contributions

#### Scenario: Scene blend iterates the active union
- **WHEN** different gestures are active in the left and right scene endpoints
- **AND** scene blend is between the endpoints
- **THEN** compute and edit distribution iterate the union of the two 64-bit active selectors
- **AND** each effective gesture weight retains the existing endpoint/blend semantics

#### Scenario: Selection and activation remain distinct
- **WHEN** a gesture is selected globally but inactive for a parameter's current scenes
- **THEN** the selection bit participates in gesture arming during an edit
- **AND** the gesture contributes nothing to parameter compute until its per-scene active bit is set

### Requirement: spm-74 — Ownership: neutral local modulation-depth reclamation
WHEN local modulation-depth storage is maintained at a safe control boundary, THE synth parameter modulation system SHALL recursively detach and recycle a local modulation-depth parameter that is a neutral leaf, is not pinned by a live modulation view, and has no non-default state that would affect future editing or persistence; SHALL preserve manager-registered top-level parameter objects and addresses; and SHALL reuse recycled local slots before requesting additional parameter storage.

#### Scenario: Neutral leaf is reclaimed
- **WHEN** a local modulation-depth parameter has neutral/default depth state in every scene
- **AND** it has no child modulation routes, active gestures, non-default latent gesture values, or live modulation-view pin
- **THEN** garbage collection clears the parent's source-index assignment
- **AND** returns the local slot to its group's reusable pool

#### Scenario: Non-neutral state prevents reclamation
- **WHEN** a local modulation-depth parameter is non-neutral in any scene or gesture state preserved by patch JSON
- **THEN** garbage collection retains the parameter and its parent assignment

#### Scenario: Child route prevents reclamation
- **WHEN** a neutral local modulation-depth parameter still owns a child modulation route that cannot itself be reclaimed
- **THEN** garbage collection retains the parent local parameter

#### Scenario: Recursive collection collapses a neutral subtree
- **WHEN** every node in a modulation-depth subtree is a reclaimable neutral leaf after its children are visited
- **THEN** bottom-up garbage collection recycles the complete subtree

#### Scenario: Visible modulation control is pinned
- **WHEN** a local modulation-depth parameter is visible in an open bank modulation view
- **THEN** garbage collection does not detach or recycle it
- **AND** collection may reconsider it after the view closes

#### Scenario: Recycled slot avoids capacity growth
- **WHEN** a neutral local slot has been reclaimed
- **AND** a later edit materializes another local modulation-depth parameter with the same group shape
- **THEN** the group reuses the reclaimed slot before requesting a new storage batch
- **AND** the recycled parameter begins with fully reset default state and resolved metadata for its new parent and source index
- **AND** capacity checks count the recycled slot before requesting new backing storage
- **AND** high-water storage count and storage-local index inspection remain stable while live-local and free-slot counts describe current topology

#### Scenario: Collection preserves patch representation
- **WHEN** a parameter graph is serialized before and after reclaiming only eligible neutral local nodes
- **THEN** both value JSON documents are semantically identical
- **AND** loading either document reconstructs the same non-default modulation graph and parameter outputs

### Requirement: spm-75 — Disconnected sources are empty modulation-view positions
WHEN a bank opens a parameter's modulation view, THE parameter-modulation system SHALL preserve one physical position for every configured modulator index; SHALL expose and materialize a depth parameter only for indexes whose `ModulatorMetadata.connected` is true; SHALL represent every disconnected index with a null bank cell that publishes disconnected UI state and ignores encoder and modifier input; SHALL count only connected missing depths during capacity preflight; and SHALL limit Random Mod selection to connected source indexes.

#### Scenario: Disconnected index stays empty
- **WHEN** a modulation view opens for a group with a disconnected source index
- **THEN** that physical position has no visible parameter and publishes `connected=false`
- **AND** opening the view does not allocate or assign a modulation-depth parameter for that index

#### Scenario: Disconnected position ignores UI input
- **WHEN** the user turns or presses the disconnected position with no modifier, Reset, or Random held
- **THEN** no parameter value, selection, storage request, or topology changes

#### Scenario: Capacity preflight counts connected depths only
- **WHEN** a modulation view has connected and disconnected indexes without existing depth parameters
- **THEN** opening the view requires storage only for the connected missing depths
- **AND** disconnected positions do not prevent the view from opening

#### Scenario: Random Mod excludes disconnected indexes
- **WHEN** Random Mod applies to a parameter whose group contains disconnected source indexes
- **THEN** it can create or change depths only at connected indexes
- **AND** if no source index is connected, it is a no-op without a storage request

#### Scenario: Explicit disconnected depth remains hidden
- **WHEN** programmatic or legacy code has assigned a depth parameter at an index whose source metadata is disconnected
- **THEN** the modulation view still exposes that index as an empty disconnected position
- **AND** the explicit parameter API and stored depth object are otherwise unchanged

### Requirement: spm-76 — Edits: exact absolute scene and gesture distribution
WHEN `Parameter::HandleSetAbsolute(scene, normalizedTarget)` is called with a finite normalized target, THE parameter SHALL clamp the target to `[0, 1]`, map it to the parameter range, arm every selected inactive gesture for the touched scene endpoints by copying the matching parent scene values, rebuild the contribution coefficients after arming, include those newly armed gestures and every already-active gesture with positive effective weight regardless of current selection, and apply a range-constrained minimum-change weighted projection to the distinct contributing scene-center and gesture-value storage locations such that production `ComputeRawCenter(scene)` before target-center slew yields the mapped target within absolute tolerance `1e-5`, every changed latent value remains in range, and unrelated storage remains unchanged. The routed production handler SHALL be `noexcept`, SHALL use no dynamic allocation, SHALL use a fixed-capacity workspace supporting the exact maximum `2 + 2 * 64 = 130` latent locations, and SHALL leave scene centers, gesture values, and gesture-active masks unchanged when internal scene, topology, storage, weight, capacity, or projection invariants reject the edit.

#### Scenario: Endpoint absolute edit
- **WHEN** a parameter has no active positive-weight gesture contribution and scene blend is at the left endpoint
- **AND** `HandleSetAbsolute(scene, 0.75)` is called on a unipolar parameter
- **THEN** the left scene center becomes `0.75` within tolerance `1e-5`
- **AND** the raw scene/gesture center before target-center slew is `0.75` within tolerance `1e-5`
- **AND** the right scene center is unchanged

#### Scenario: Intermediate scene blend reaches the target
- **WHEN** distinct left and right scene centers contribute at an intermediate scene blend
- **AND** `HandleSetAbsolute` receives an in-range target different from the current effective value
- **THEN** it moves the two scene centers in proportion to their effective contribution coefficients with saturation redistribution where required
- **AND** `ComputeRawCenter(scene)` before target-center slew equals the mapped target within tolerance `1e-5`

#### Scenario: First absolute message arms and applies
- **WHEN** a selected gesture is inactive for a parameter at the touched scene endpoints
- **AND** one absolute message targets a value different from the current effective value
- **THEN** that same message activates the gesture and initially copies the applicable parent scene values
- **AND** rebuilds all contribution coefficients after arming because arming may reweight other active gestures and change the pre-solve value
- **AND** includes the newly active gesture in the exact-target projection without swallowing the target
- **AND** `ComputeRawCenter(scene)` before target-center slew equals the mapped target within tolerance `1e-5`

#### Scenario: Active deselected gestures participate
- **WHEN** one or more positive-weight gestures are active for the current scene selection but are not currently selected
- **AND** `HandleSetAbsolute` receives a new target
- **THEN** their gesture values participate according to the existing effective gesture weights
- **AND** `ComputeRawCenter(scene)` before target-center slew equals the mapped target within tolerance `1e-5`

#### Scenario: Saturated contributors redistribute residual
- **WHEN** the unconstrained weighted update would move any contributing latent value outside the parameter range
- **THEN** the handler fixes that value at the approached range endpoint
- **AND** redistributes the remaining residual over unsaturated contributors
- **AND** leaves every latent value in range and reaches the mapped target within tolerance `1e-5`

#### Scenario: Shared scene endpoint is updated once
- **WHEN** the left and right scene endpoints refer to the same scene storage
- **THEN** the solver combines their coefficients before applying the projection
- **AND** does not apply two writes to the same latent location

#### Scenario: Randomized exactness invariant
- **WHEN** deterministic model tests generate valid scene blends, scene centers, gesture activation masks, gesture weights, latent gesture values, parameter ranges, and absolute targets
- **THEN** every production edit's `ComputeRawCenter(scene)` before target-center slew matches an independently computed target within tolerance `1e-5`
- **AND** every latent value remains in range
- **AND** inactive unrelated storage is unchanged

#### Scenario: Invalid internal state is a mutation-free no-op
- **WHEN** the routed absolute handler encounters an invalid scene, backing-storage topology, non-finite or out-of-range relevant latent state, invalid relevant gesture weight, workspace-capacity failure, or rejected projection
- **THEN** it returns without throwing or dynamically allocating
- **AND** scene centers, gesture values, and gesture-active masks are unchanged

### Requirement: spm-77 — Messaging: absolute parameter routing
WHEN a `MessageIn::ParamSetAbsolute(timestamp, slotIx, position, normalizedValue)` reaches `MessageInBus`, THE synth parameter modulation system SHALL treat `normalizedValue` as a parameter-space float target in `[0, 1]` rather than as a raw MIDI velocity, SHALL route it by slot and position through `ParameterManager`, `BankSlot`, and the selected `Bank` to the parameter or modulation-depth control currently visible in that cell's `HandleSetAbsolute`, SHALL use that parameter's owning scene and gesture context, SHALL ignore the edit while any effective modifier is active in the same manner as `ParamIncDec`, and SHALL leave state unchanged when the slot, position, cell, or parameter is not mapped.

#### Scenario: Absolute message reaches visible parameter
- **WHEN** a selected bank maps slot `0` position `2` to a visible parameter
- **AND** the bus applies `ParamSetAbsolute(..., 0, 2, 0.5)` with no modifier active
- **THEN** the mapped parameter handles absolute float target `0.5` unchanged
- **AND** its `ComputeRawCenter(scene)` before target-center slew equals the mapped target within tolerance `1e-5`

#### Scenario: Modulation-depth view receives absolute edit
- **WHEN** a bank's modulation-depth view maps a slot position to a materialized modulation-depth parameter
- **AND** an absolute message addresses that position with no modifier active
- **THEN** the visible modulation-depth parameter receives `HandleSetAbsolute`
- **AND** the hidden top-level parameter is not edited by that message

#### Scenario: Modifier blocks absolute edit
- **WHEN** any effective modifier is active
- **AND** the bus applies a mapped `ParamSetAbsolute` message
- **THEN** it does not perform an absolute edit

#### Scenario: Unmapped absolute address is a no-op
- **WHEN** `ParamSetAbsolute` addresses an absent slot, out-of-range position, disconnected cell, or cell without a parameter
- **THEN** parameter state remains unchanged

### Requirement: spm-78 — MIDI absolute feedback: causal acknowledgement and debounce
WHEN an absolute encoder input mapping accepts raw 7-bit byte `B`, THE synth parameter modulation system SHALL allocate a globally monotonically increasing nonzero runtime epoch, publish that epoch and received byte as the matching controller route's unresolved output expectation before the epoch-bearing `ParamSetAbsolute` float target `(B / 127)^a` becomes visible to `MessageInBus`, where `a = log(0.5) / log(64 / 127)`, process the parameter edit or rejection on the audio thread, record the epoch as processed for the addressed slot position, and publish that processed epoch coherently with the position's normalized pre-modulation scene/gesture raw center; WHILE the published processed epoch precedes the latest expected epoch, absolute output SHALL emit no position feedback and SHALL NOT mutate its position debounce cache; WHEN the processed epoch reaches or passes the expectation, absolute output SHALL convert normalized raw center `x` to byte `round(127 * clamp(x, 0, 1)^(1/a))`, suppress output exactly when that byte equals the received byte, otherwise emit that actual byte once as a correction, and then resume ordinary debounce using final 7-bit bytes; relative encoder input and output SHALL remain outside this protocol and retain post-modulation display feedback.

#### Scenario: Applied absolute input does not echo
- **WHEN** absolute input receives byte `B`, queues epoch `E`, and DSP applies the exact normalized target `(B / 127)^a`
- **AND** UI state publishes processed epoch at least `E` with that raw center
- **THEN** inverse conversion and 7-bit quantization recover byte `B`
- **AND** absolute output emits no position message for `B`
- **AND** records byte `B` for subsequent debounce

#### Scenario: Absolute midpoint outputs MIDI center
- **WHEN** absolute output observes normalized raw knob position `0.5`
- **THEN** inverse conversion produces `64 / 127` before quantization
- **AND** the emitted or debounced MIDI position byte is `64`

#### Scenario: Output debounce remains in the 7-bit domain
- **WHEN** consecutive normalized raw knob positions inverse-convert and quantize to the same 7-bit byte
- **THEN** absolute output emits that byte at most once
- **AND** its position cache stores and compares the 7-bit byte rather than the pre-quantized float

#### Scenario: Output waits for DSP acknowledgement
- **WHEN** absolute input has published expected epoch `E`
- **AND** the latest stable UI snapshot for the route has processed epoch less than `E`
- **THEN** absolute output emits no position message for that route
- **AND** leaves the route's position cache unchanged
- **AND** may continue independent color and brightness feedback

#### Scenario: Rejected absolute input is corrected
- **WHEN** absolute byte `B` with epoch `E` is rejected because a modifier is active or the routed edit cannot apply
- **THEN** the slot position still publishes processed epoch at least `E`
- **AND** if the inverse-curved and quantized actual raw-center byte differs from `B`, output emits the actual byte once even when it equals the pre-input cached value
- **AND** if the actual raw-center byte equals `B`, output emits no unnecessary correction

#### Scenario: Disconnected pending route resolves as blank
- **WHEN** an absolute route becomes disconnected after receiving byte `B` with epoch `E`
- **AND** the disconnected cell publishes processed epoch at least `E` with neutral raw center `0`
- **THEN** resolution leaves the controller's primary encoder/ring at blank byte `0`
- **AND** it suppresses output if `B` was already `0`, otherwise emits one channel-0 blank correction

#### Scenario: Queue failure restores the prior expectation
- **WHEN** an absolute input publishes a tentative expectation and the bounded MIDI input bus rejects its message
- **THEN** the coordinator conditionally restores the route's preceding expectation when no newer input superseded it
- **AND** the failed event does not persistently alter output debounce state
- **AND** output never emits a value derived from treating the failed event as processed

#### Scenario: Rapid input resolves only the latest expectation
- **WHEN** a route receives increasing epochs `E1`, `E2`, and `E3` before UI publication catches up
- **THEN** output remains gated until a stable snapshot has processed epoch at least `E3`
- **AND** resolves against the received byte for `E3` and the actual raw center after that processed prefix
- **AND** does not echo or correct the superseded expectations separately

#### Scenario: Multiple controllers share one cell
- **WHEN** two absolute controllers have independent expected epochs and received bytes for the same slot position
- **AND** the cell publishes a processed epoch and actual raw center covering both events
- **THEN** each controller resolves its own expectation against the inverse-curved and quantized byte for that common actual center
- **AND** the controller whose received byte equals the actual byte suppresses its echo
- **AND** any other controller receives a correction when its byte differs

#### Scenario: Bank or modulation-view change cannot strand acknowledgement
- **WHEN** an absolute message addresses a slot position and the selected bank or modulation-depth view changes before the next output poll
- **THEN** processed-epoch acknowledgement remains associated with the slot position rather than the former parameter object
- **AND** the currently visible cell publishes that acknowledgement with its actual raw center

#### Scenario: Profile rebuild preserves pending coordination
- **WHEN** controller processors rebuild after an absolute expectation is published but before it is resolved
- **THEN** the engine-owned coordinator retains that expectation
- **AND** the rebuilt absolute output processor remains gated until acknowledgement and performs the same suppression-or-correction decision

#### Scenario: Relative feedback remains modulation-aware
- **WHEN** a controller uses either relative encoder mode
- **AND** modulation changes the existing voice-0 display value without moving the scene/gesture center
- **THEN** its encoder output continues to follow the existing post-modulation display value
- **AND** it neither applies the absolute curve nor allocates or waits for an absolute epoch

#### Scenario: Epoch zero remains untracked
- **WHEN** a `ParamSetAbsolute` message is created outside the epoch-allocating absolute-encoder path with epoch `0`
- **THEN** it retains the existing absolute apply-or-reject routing behavior
- **AND** it creates no output expectation and does not advance a slot's processed absolute epoch

#### Scenario: Coordinator capacity exhaustion fails closed
- **WHEN** profile construction cannot reserve one of the coordinator's 4096 runtime-lifetime route records for a newly configured absolute mapping
- **THEN** a matching hardware turn remains consumed as a mapped controller message but does not queue `ParamSetAbsolute`
- **AND** output for that untracked mapping uses ordinary inverse-curved 7-bit debounce without creating or waiting for an expectation
- **AND** no untracked absolute input is applied in a way that can be overwritten by stale feedback

#### Scenario: Unstable snapshot cannot resolve expectation
- **WHEN** output cannot obtain one stable revision containing both processed epoch and raw center
- **THEN** it emits no absolute position feedback from that read
- **AND** leaves the pending expectation and position cache unchanged for retry

#### Scenario: Correction enqueue failure retries
- **WHEN** an acknowledged actual byte differs from the received byte but the MIDI sender rejects the correction enqueue
- **THEN** output leaves the expectation unresolved and the position cache unchanged
- **AND** a later process pass retries the correction

### Requirement: spm-79 — MIDI output: Generic encoder position feedback
WHEN a Generic controller profile contains encoder-turn input mappings and no explicit encoder output, THE synth parameter modulation system SHALL automatically create position feedback from those turn mappings; for each mapping it SHALL emit at most one debounced MIDI CC using exactly the mapping's input channel and CC and the mapped encoder position byte, SHALL emit no color, brightness, animation, SysEx, or auxiliary feedback, SHALL use the causal absolute acknowledgement protocol when the encoder input mode is Absolute, and SHALL use the existing post-modulation display position without epoch coordination in either relative mode; an explicit Twister or WRLD.Bldr encoder output SHALL override automatic Generic feedback.

#### Scenario: Generic output mirrors the full input address
- **WHEN** a Generic turn mapping uses zero-based channel `C` and CC `N`
- **AND** its mapped position requires feedback byte `V`
- **THEN** automatic Generic output emits exactly one CC `(C, N, V)`
- **AND** emits no other MIDI message for that mapping

#### Scenario: Generic absolute output uses causal acknowledgement
- **WHEN** a Generic controller in Absolute mode receives byte `B` on one of its turn mappings
- **THEN** its automatically derived output waits for the mapping's processed epoch
- **AND** suppresses output when the acknowledged raw-center byte equals `B`
- **AND** emits one correction on the same channel and CC when the acknowledged raw-center byte differs
- **AND** retains the pending expectation and cache for retry when correction enqueue fails

#### Scenario: Generic relative output remains modulation-aware
- **WHEN** a Generic controller uses either relative encoder mode
- **AND** modulation changes the mapped post-modulation display position
- **THEN** automatic Generic output emits the changed position on the turn mapping's same channel and CC
- **AND** allocates, waits for, and resolves no absolute epoch

#### Scenario: Explicit specialized output overrides Generic derivation
- **WHEN** a Generic profile contains encoder input and an explicit Twister or WRLD.Bldr encoder output
- **THEN** profile construction creates only the explicit specialized output
- **AND** does not also create automatic Generic CC feedback

#### Scenario: Generic profile without encoder input has no derived output
- **WHEN** a Generic profile has no encoder input
- **THEN** profile construction creates no automatic Generic encoder output

### Requirement: spm-80 — MIDI input: note-addressed controller buttons

WHEN a controller profile configures an encoder push or Generic system-message control address, THE synth parameter modulation system SHALL allow the address
to select CC or note while retaining numeric channel and message-number fields,
SHALL match the configured message type as part of the address, SHALL classify
CC nonzero and note-on positive velocity as press, and SHALL classify CC zero,
note-on zero velocity, and note-off as release.

#### Scenario: Note encoder push emits parameter push

- **WHEN** an encoder push maps note `60` on channel `1` to slot `2` position `3`
- **AND** the input processor receives note-on for channel `1`, note `60`, and positive velocity
- **THEN** it pushes `MessageIn::ParamPush` for slot `2` position `3`

#### Scenario: Note encoder release does not emit another push

- **WHEN** an encoder push maps note `60` on channel `1`
- **AND** the input processor receives raw note-on with zero velocity or note-off with nonzero release velocity for that address
- **THEN** it does not push a parameter command

#### Scenario: Generic note system message emits press and release

- **WHEN** a Generic system-message association maps note `42` on channel `4` to configured press and release messages
- **AND** the processor receives note-on with positive velocity followed by note-off for that address
- **THEN** it emits the configured press message followed by the configured release message

#### Scenario: Zero-velocity note-on is release

- **WHEN** a Generic note system-message association has a configured release message
- **AND** the processor receives note-on with velocity `0` for the mapped channel and note number
- **THEN** it emits the configured release message

#### Scenario: Note system message emits no CC feedback

- **WHEN** a Generic system-message association uses a note control address and has output feedback enabled
- **AND** profile output processors are built and process its derived state
- **THEN** no CC or note feedback message is emitted for that association

#### Scenario: Message type participates in matching

- **WHEN** a profile maps a note address and receives a CC with the same channel and numeric value
- **THEN** that mapping does not consume the CC as its press or release

#### Scenario: Typed addresses round trip

- **WHEN** a profile containing note-addressed encoder pushes and Generic system messages is serialized and loaded
- **THEN** the loaded mappings preserve note message type, channel, and numeric value

#### Scenario: Existing addresses default to CC

- **WHEN** profile JSON contains an existing control address without a message type
- **THEN** loading treats that address as CC and preserves its existing behavior
