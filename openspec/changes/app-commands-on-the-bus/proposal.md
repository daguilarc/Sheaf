# Proposal — `app-commands-on-the-bus`

Paired with frogg3rs `frogg3rs-presses-on-the-bus`, whose task list is the
one task list for both trees (the S tasks). Base: b49b7720
(`shifted-encoder-turns`, PR #20). Supersedes the unpushed `app-o1-audit`.

## Why

An app's own commands (Frogg3rs's Randomize, Reset, page select, encoder
press) have no audio-thread delivery in this library. `MessageIn::AppAction`
is popped on the audio thread and forwarded straight back to the message
thread (`ParameterMessageOut::AppAction` → `Engine::MessageThreadTick` →
`PortableSurface().DispatchAction`), which is right for a MIDI controller
addressing a UI action and wrong for a command whose target is audio-thread
state. The app then builds its own bridge back: Frogg3rs used single-slot
atomics, which lose count and order inside one message tick, and
`app-o1-audit` answered with a second queue beside this library's, a shared
sequence number against the patch bus (`InputOrder`, `HasOrderedPresses`),
and a construct that holds an operation until depth storage covers it
(`RunIfDepthStorageCovers`). All of it duplicates ordering this library's
`MessageInBus` already provides.

Tempo already has the right shape: `SetTempoBpmNormalized` and
`TempoBpmIncDec` on both buses, applied to the master clock in
`MessageInBus::Apply` with the catalog's tempo range. This change gives app
commands the same shape.

Depth storage has two gaps an out-of-tree app hits. The low watermark that
triggers a storage request is a fixed multiple of the modulator count, sized
for one encoder press; an app whose one press can create a depth on every
parameter needs a larger number. And a patch whose depths exceed
available storage applies with depths missing and reports Ok, at startup
and while running; the engine already retries an arena-exhausted patch
message at both of its apply sites, and a storage shortfall is the second
reason for the same retry.

## What changes

1. **`MessageIn::Type::AppCommand`** (appended after `SetTempoBpmNormalized`;
   every existing enumerator keeps its ordinal, as `SystemMessageSortKey`
   requires). It carries an app-defined command number and a float value,
   and this library never interprets either: the app pushes it from its
   surface and applies it in its own hook. `MessageIn::AppCommand(timestamp,
   command, value)`. `Engine::DrainMessageBus` hands it to
   `app_.ApplyAppCommand(command, value)` under
   `if constexpr (HasAppCommands<App>)` and applies it in the block that
   pops it, in FIFO order with the non-realtime messages on that bus; for
   an app without the hook, `MessageInBus::Apply` drops it, since only that
   app's own surface produces one and no controller profile can name it.
   Start, Continue, Stop and Clock stay realtime messages, lifted out of
   both buses and applied after both drain. No message is ever held at the
   head of a bus.
2. **The low watermark is a group setting.**
   `ParameterGroup::SetStorageLowWatermark(std::size_t)`; the existing
   `RequestParameterStorageBatchIfLow` reads it at its existing call sites
   (every local allocation on the audio thread), compared against
   `AvailableParameterSlots()` as today. Default unchanged
   (`numModulators * 2`).
3. **A patch never applies with a depth missing**, at startup or running,
   and it gets its storage the way an exhausted arena already gets grown.
   Two sites apply patch messages and both already retry the arena case:
   `ApplyPendingPatchMessages` at `Initialize`, before audio, growing the
   arena inline; and `ProcessBlock`, stashing the message
   (`pendingPatchMessage_`, `arenaGrowPending_`) for `MessageThreadTick` to
   grow it. `ApplyPatchMessageAndNotifyApp` reports a storage shortfall
   (per group, counted by `MissingDepthsForValuesJSON`, carried from
   `app-o1-audit` without the construct or the startup branch around it)
   when the patch's depths would leave available storage below the group's
   watermark. Each site keeps its own growth step for the arena branch
   (`GrowAndReset` inline at startup; `GrowSerializationArenaForTick` with
   its cap while running); the stash-and-raise around either branch, at the
   two running call sites (`ProcessBlock`'s retry and its drain), is one
   shared helper parameterized by the reason (arena or storage), so that
   duplication is not doubled by the second reason. The storage branch is
   one helper, written once in `Engine`:
   `AddParameterStorageBatch` of need plus watermark on each group, called
   directly so the group's pending low-water request cannot absorb it; the
   tick's existing handling of a `ParameterStorageBatchNeeded` message
   calls the same helper. At startup the helper runs inline and the message
   retries at once. Running, the audio thread writes the per-group need
   beside the stash, only when no storage stash is pending, and sets a
   storage flag of its own (never the arena flag, whose cap path drops the
   message) with release order; the barrier holds the stash while either
   flag is set; a retry that still reports the shortfall re-stashes under
   the storage reason; the tick provisions, clears the flag with release
   order after its last read of the need, and the stashed message retries
   on the first block after the clear, the running patch untouched until it
   applies whole. Known and stated at the
   stash: a message applied while a running Load waits is overwritten by
   the patch when it applies, as one applied in the block before a Load is
   today.
4. **`AppContext` exposes what the engine already publishes** for the
   runtime pages: `clockDiagnostics` (a pointer to
   `ClockDiagnosticsPublication`, whose `ClockDiagnostics` gains
   `transportState`, filled by `MasterClock::DiagnosticsSnapshot` and packed
   into the publication's metadata word) and `syncConfiguration` (the
   requested `SyncConfig`, from `Engine::SyncConfigurationSnapshot`), each
   stating its thread at the field. This is an added requirement; `sar-3` is
   not modified here, because `fold-controller-wizard-into-add-row` (#19)
   already modifies it.
5. **Carried from `app-o1-audit`**, with their spec deltas: storage batches
   appended while the audio thread reads; output processors resend a
   declined update; `Engine.hpp`'s false comments; the library devices an
   app offers; a gesture reference naming a gesture the app has; the
   Launchpad "Model" caption; stale text; `HasMessageThreadTick`; a row
   field edit without the section rebuild; the hygiene commit; and the
   `app-operator-runs` change, left open.
6. **Dropped from `app-o1-audit`**: the construct that held a depth-creating
   operation until storage covered it, and the ordering fix that ran every
   patch message relative to the app's own presses -- this change's
   `MessageIn::AppCommand` on the bus and the patch-storage retry replace
   both; the depth compute-skip (its removal is the WIP the branch stopped
   in, and the audio-equality check never ran); and every O(1)
   implementation gated on a frogg3rs measurement that was not a finding.

## Structural decisions

**A new type rather than an audio-thread interception of `AppAction`.**
`AppAction` is what a controller profile names and what the Controllers
page dispatches to the surface; its consumer is the message thread. A
command's consumer is the audio thread. Splitting by consumer keeps
`Origin` out of the decision, lets a MIDI press and a click join the same
route at the surface, and leaves every existing profile unchanged. The
command number is the app's rather than a catalog index because the
catalog indexes what a controller can be mapped to, and an app's encoder
press is deliberately not in it (`encoderPressAction` is forwarded as its
own kind); the app produces and consumes both ends, so the number is its
own.

**No hold.** A held head would keep the Start, Stop and Clock messages
pushed behind it (they are lifted into the realtime batch only when
popped), so a hold would delay transport by however long storage took.
Storage is kept ahead of the presses instead: the watermark and the Load
rule together keep available storage above one press whenever a press can
arrive.

**A watermark setting, not a covering construct.** The library already
requests storage when available slots fall below a watermark, at every
audio-thread allocation. An app whose one press can add more depths than a
Braid encoder press needs a larger number, not a new mechanism.

**A patch's storage reuses the arena retry, at both sites.** Two shortfalls
(JSON arena, depth storage) with one shape at each of the two apply sites:
grow inline before audio; stash, provision on the message thread and retry
while running. The second reason moves into the constructs the first
built, under its own flag so the arena's cap path cannot drop it; the
arena's own growth stays per site, and only the storage provisioning is
shared, once, with the tick's existing storage-batch handling. The startup site matters most to the player: a relaunch
opens with the saved patch, and a launch batch that leaves less than the
watermark free would otherwise drop every saved patch that carries a
depth.

## Overlap with other active changes

Four open changes in the stack add `MessageIn::Type` enumerators
(`bank-addressed-absolute-write`: `ParamSetAbsoluteOnBank`;
`app-midi-catalog`: `HoldDrill`; `shift-and-file-export`: `Shift`;
`shifted-encoder-turns`: `SceneBlendIncDec`, `TempoBpmIncDec`,
`SetTempoBpmNormalized`), each appended after the last and each saying
earlier ordinals keep; this change's `AppCommand` is appended after the
last of them, so it is new-branch work and every prior text stays true. No
open change touches `DrainMessageBus`, `RequestParameterStorageBatchIfLow`,
`ApplyPendingPatchMessages` or `ClockDiagnostics`. An open change modifies
`sar-3`, which is why the context fields here are an added requirement
rather than a modified one. Two open changes add a `sar-33`, which this
change renumbers in the later one. `fork/app-midi-out` is the scrapped
MIDI-out record, stays on its old base and is not pushed. The executor
re-enumerates before the first amendment.

## Delivery

The fork's open PRs #9 to #20 are one linear stack against upstream main.
Each piece of this change lands in the PR whose diff introduced the concept
it extends, or in the new branch when its code depends on anything present
only higher in the stack or extends upstream code no PR introduced; the
executor decides each placement from the tree and reports it. Branches
above each amendment are rebased and force-pushed, so their PRs update.
The app command, the watermark setting, the patch storage retry, the
storage race and resend fixes, and the two change directories go up as
`app-commands-on-the-bus`, the next sequential PR on the new tip. `projects/synth test` and the miniapp
target (the runtime shell is not in the synth gate) at the new tip before
any push; the push itself waits for the frogg3rs suite to be green against
the local tip, then the frogg3rs pin moves to the pushed SHA.
